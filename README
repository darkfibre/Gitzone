This is my first attempt at writing anything in ruby.  My code probably sucks.

This project requires the 'dnsruby' ruby gem.

gitzone.rb - pulls a DNZ zone via AXFR and commits it to a specified git repository.

config.yaml - configuration file, provides the directory to store the zone files as well as the domains and nameservers they are pulled from.
