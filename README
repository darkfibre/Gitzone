This is my first attempt at writing anything in ruby.

Basic functionality exists at this point, it does need some healthy exception handling.

This project requires the 'dnsruby' ruby gem.

gitzone.rb - pulls a DNZ zone via AXFR and commits it to a specified git repository.
  It is required that the repository exist and files already be added to it.

config.yaml - configuration file, provides the directory to store the zone files as well as the domains and nameservers they are pulled from.
